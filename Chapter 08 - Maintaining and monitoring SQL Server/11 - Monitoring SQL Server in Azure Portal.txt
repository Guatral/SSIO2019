//As with Azure Monitor, results of Log Analytics queries can be pinned to a Microsoft Azure Portal dashboard by using the Pin to Dashboard button in the header bar. 
//This query will work with any Log Analytics workspaces that have SQL databases sending log data.

//This second example is a minor demonstration of the power and ease of drawing meaningful metrics out of the log data stream coming from Azure SQL resources,
//a more sophisticated look that should be more useful and readable at larger time scales.
